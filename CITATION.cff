  Scientry is an AI-powered research assistant designed to
  simplify and enhance access to scientific knowledge. It
  generates concise summaries and interactive mindmaps from
  research papers sourced from platforms like ArXiv and
  PubMed Central, making complex information more
  accessible. The app ensures faster data retrieval through
  caching, enables easy content sharing, and provides direct
  links to full papers. With future enhancements like
  bookmarking, dark mode, and full cross-platform support,
  **Scientry** aims to revolutionize the way users explore
  and understand scientific research.
